title: Identify root cause issues in your infrastructure
teaser: Use New Relic infrastructure to identify root cause issues in your infrastructure
description: |-
  ## Overview
  You’re the new IT engineer for Geek's Movie Shop, a site that's deployed across a distributed infrastructure. Your predecessors didn't instrument site's servers, so you don't know much about how they're behaving, but recent user complaints indicate that it's time to start observing your system.

  In this lab, you use New Relic infrastructure monitoring to observe your servers so you can identify and mitigate issues.

  ## Objectives
  - Instrument your hosts with our infrastructure agent
  - Gather insights from your infrastructure and related services
  - Identify root cause issues in your infrastructure


  ## Requirements
  - A free [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup?utm_source=developer-site)
